## About me


*I'm a sucker for making things run smoothly*. I've worked in a bunch of industries, ranging from legal translation, video-game QA and Localization. I pivoted to Full Stack Web development because I wanted to learn how to build the tools that make the world work and help users enjoy them. 

*Learning new skills motivates me.* I thrive when I get to teach myself a new skill, whether this means overcoming my fear of skiing or figuring out the documentation for an API I've never worked with before.
